# Graphics-Project
Here is my and my friends Graphics Project.

1.Baymax play with a ball
  It is a normal scenario based project. Baymax is a BOT character from a movie 'BIG HERO 6'. Our concept was that Baymax
	     Playing on a beach with a ball and he can fly and swim. But lastly we can't do that much. In future, we will complete that 
	     project with full implementation of our idea. 
	     
	     Now, Baymax can move only left,right,up and down along with a ball.
       
       Instruction: (Button on keyboard)
	
	        Move left  -->  left arrow button (keyboard)
	        Move right -->  right arrow button (keyboard)
	        Move up    -->  up arrow button (keyboard)
	        Move down  -->  down arrow button (keyboard)
